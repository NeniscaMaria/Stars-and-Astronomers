# Stars-and-Astronomers
--created during the second semester

This application is created using Qt in Visual Studio 2017 and the Observer design pattern.

Description:
This is an application for astronomers which helps them catalogue the stars.
->The information about the astronomers in stored in the "astronomers.txt" file and the information about the stars is stored in the "stars.txt" file.
->When the application is launched, a new window is shown for each astronomer.
->Each astronomer can see the stars from his constellation only.
->Any astronomer can add a new star.
->The astronomer can search for stars by name or coordinates. The result modifies as the user is typing.
->Each astronomer has a View button which allows him to see the star selected within its constellation. A new window will show all stars from that constallation. The selected star is red, while the others are black.
->Everything is saved in files when the application ends.

What I learned:
->how to display some dots according to given coordinates and sizes
->use the QPainter
->the Observer design pattern
